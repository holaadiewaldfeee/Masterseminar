A Precise Method-Method Interaction-Based Cohesion Metric for
Object-Oriented Classes 

- Class cohesion refers to the relatedness of the class members, and it indicates
one important aspect of the class design quality.
-A meaningful class cohesion metric
helps object-oriented software developers detect class design weaknesses and refactor
classes accordingly. 
-Most of these metrics are applicable based on low-level design information
such as attribute references in methods. Some of these metrics capture class cohesion
by counting the number of method pairs sharing common attributes.
- A few metrics
measure cohesion more precisely by considering the degree of interaction, through
attribute references, between each pair of methods. 
- This paper introduces a new cohesion metric (LSCC) that addresses a number of
problems in existing cohesion metrics that account for interactions between methods,
an important category of cohesion metrics (MMI) to support refactoring. It is defined
to be used during the Low-Level Design (LLD) phase of object-oriented software, and
is based on measuring the degree of method pair interactions caused by the sharing of
attributes in a class
