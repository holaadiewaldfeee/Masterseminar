Software fault prediction metrics: A systematic literature review

- Object-oriented and process metrics have been reported
to be more successful in finding faults compared to traditional size and complexity metrics.
-Conclusion: More studies should be performed on large industrial software systems to find metrics more
relevant for the  industry and to answer the question as to which metrics should be used in a given
context.
