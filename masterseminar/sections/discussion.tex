\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

- discuss the metrics depending on the benefits/limitations and which metrics scored well in comparison (die genauer betrachteten oder alle)

- discussion with the classification according to relevance in the development process and the relevance for stakeholder

- what you should always pay attention to, no matter how large the project is; what depends on the size of the project; other projectsprops ($\rightarrow$ limitations)


\subsection{Classification of relevance}

- in which parts of the development is it important to pay attention to fault proneness

- the aspect of fault-proneness must be considered early on, during planning and development

- in addition always pay attention to all aspects early to avoid costs etc.

- who is most influenced, developers or customers

- for the developer important how to build and construct his object-oriented classes, with a metric as orientation to avoid bugs eg

\subsection{Limitations}

- Refactoring classes requires not only accounting for cohesion, but also accounting for other quality attributes, such as coupling (ref. \cite{b8al2012precise})

- all errors that are feasible can never be covered
 
- many studies have only been tested with small software projects and classes, which is not very meaningful over large ones

\subsection{Benefits}

- advantages if fault-proneness is included in early software steps; pay attention to metrics

- note time and money
