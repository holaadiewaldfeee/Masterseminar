\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

- summarize discussion and results; name important metrics/properties that should stay in mind after reading this

- what can reduce the fault-pron in software development

- outlook

- This paper discussed the concept of fault proneness using the example of object-oriented programming and design metrics, which means that for the most part the results can only be transferred to the object-oriented context.

- maybe future work

- final catch and the link to the superordinate context (research trends in software technology); link to introduction and motivation
